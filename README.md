# DTracker — NO-TAKEOVER + Locked Fields + URL phase + Viewer progress + RESET (clears Customer/Phase)

**New in this build**
- **Reset** now also clears **Customer Name** and **Transform Cycle** in shared state, and updates the URL to `?customer=default` (removes `phase`). All tabs mirror the blank fields.
- Viewer progress overlay force-refreshes on mode & state changes to ensure it always shows up in VIEWER mode.

**Share URLs** like: `/?customer=Woolworths%20Group&phase=Stabilize`
